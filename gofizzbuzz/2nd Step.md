- Modify the code you made on Step1 to a web API.
- Request
  - Endpoint is `http://<domain>:8080/fizzbuzz`.
  - You don't have to send any param & data.
  - Run the FizzBuzz function which you make on Step1 when you send requests to the endpoint.
- Response

  - When the number is multiple of "3", print "Fizz" instead of the number.
